Tell us about your protocol:

We followed the protocol given to us in the rubric, with a few additions.  Message type 19 (client to server) requests a hint (three extra
cards dealt).  Message 20 (server to client) will approve the request for a hint, and deal three extra cards (the dealing will be handled through a 
call of Message type 5), and Message 21 (server to client) will reject the request if three hints (making for a total of 21 cards on the field, reason 1)
or if no cards are left in the deck (reason 2).


If there is anything else we should know about your work on this assignment, 
please explain here:

1.  The constant MAX_PLAYERS in NetworkView represents the number of clients that must be started up before cards can be dealt to the field
2.  Cards labeled "Ovals" are actually rectangles.
3.  The "TIMEOUT" message pertaining to message type 18 is not being used for the game, but we coded the message in as an option 
	for compatibility with other servers.
4.  To test with multiple clients without a BindException, run one instance of ServerMain and multiple instance of ClientMain
